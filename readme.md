This is example company site for my personal purposes. It's just my playground until I make up with something.

Demo page: https://awesome-bassi-04323e.netlify.com

## Known issues:
-   On the demo page if you go into subpages directly you will see 404 NOT FOUND. Rewriting rules are needed to be written.
